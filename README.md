# sf-movies
A service that shows on a map where movies have been filmed in San Francisco. 

The user should be able to filter the view using autocompletion search.

The data is available on <a href="http://www.datasf.org/">DataSF</a>:<a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am">Film Locations </a>

## Technical spec

The architecture will be split between a back-end and a web front-end, for instance providing a JSON in/out RESTful API. Feel free to use any other technologies provided that the general client/service architecture is respected.

Choose one of the following technical tracks that best suits your skillset:

- Full-stack: include both front-end and back-end.
- Back-end track: include a minimal front-end (e.g. a static view or API docs). Write, document and test your API as if it will be used by other services.
- Front-end track: include a minimal back-end, or use the data service directly. Focus on making the interface as polished as possible.
